# AdvancedCTaP - EL2520 (Spring 2024)
Repository for the Control Theory and Practice, Advanced Course (AdvancedCTaP) coursework. This repository contains the laboratory code and resources for the course homework for the EL2520 course at KTH in the spring term of 2024. This repository is made with collaboration with Simon Sp√•ng.

## Course Overview

The course provides an introduction into multivariable and robust control, utilizing the book Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design by Skogestad and Postlethwaite. This coursework consists of four homework assignments and one laboratory prject (four-tank process).

### Homework Assignments

1. **Homework 1 - Classical Loop-Shaping**
   - Computer exercises using MATLAB/SIMULINK on classical loop-shaping in order to achieve performance specifications on disturbance rejection and reference tracking using a 2-DOF design.

3. **Homework 2 - Multivariable Systems**
   - Computer exercises using MATLAB/SIMULINK on the analysis of multivariable systems and the effects of different phenomena (e.g. directions, minimum-phase, etc.). Furthermore, RGA is used to investigate the suitability of the decentralized control design.

3. **Homework 3 - H-inf Control Design**
   - Computer exercises using MATLAB/SIMULINK on H-inf control design in order to shape relevant closed-loop functions and fulfill desired specifications on sesitivity and robustness.

3. **Homework 4 - Decoupling & Glover-McFarlane Robust Loop Shaping**
   - Computer exercises using MATLAB/SIMULINK on different decoupling methods followed by robustification using a method proposed by Glover and McFarlane.

### Laboratory Work

In addition to the homework assignments, the Laboratory prjoect entails:

- **Project**
   - Multivariable Control of the four-tank process in different configurations
        - Interactions between inputs and outputs are investigated in two configurations (minimum-phase and non-minimum phase case)
        - Model parameters are identified using simple experiments.
        - Two controllers were designed using different decoupling methods followed by robustification using Glover and McFarlane for each minimum-phase case.
        - Validation of controllers on real plant and comparison of perfromance.
